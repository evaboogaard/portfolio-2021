        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Museum Match was designed to be in the style of the paper ISGA-guide made by minor-students of the HvA. The
            ISGA guide is targeted towards international exchange-students that live in Amsterdam to study. This static
            prototype built with HTML and CSS is a Tinder-like system that familiarizes the new international students
            with the different kinds of museums and artworks in Amsterdam.</p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>This project started off with analysing interviews of international students that live in Amsterdam. The
            questions were all about what surprised them about the city and what the ‘tips and tricks’ were for students
            like them.</p>
        <p>Immediately I knew: I want to create an application that gets young, international students in touch with the
            amazing museums this city has to offer.</p>

            
        <p>For this project I:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>created my own version of the Style Guide of ISGA</li>
            <li>made my own illustrations</li>
            <li>made a flowchart</li>
            <li>took pictures of the artworks that are in the app</li>
            <li>coded a static prototype using HTML & CSS</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>End Result</h3>
        <p>I created a concept that is basically Tinder for museums in Amsterdam. For international exchange-students
            this is a very accessible way to let them get into contact with the museums.</p>
        <p>The <em>navigation</em> in Museum Match is quite easy to understand. By using <em>preselection during onboarding</em> the user
            can fill in their interests and get the best artwork recommendations.</p>
        <p>If you have an account, you can like a few artworks and find a match after you’ve liked three artworks of the
            same exhibition.</p>
