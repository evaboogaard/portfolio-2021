            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>To become more proficient in writing code, a copy of an exisiting website was created. This was an
                opportunity to create a website that is better than the original - not just visually, but also within
                the code. This website isn't originally made by me - but it was a great tool to learn more about semantically correct coding and styling. </p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>This project started off with analysing the website into a breakdown sketch to put into html. After
                    this, the html could be styled intensively with CSS. </p>
                <p>Most of the website has been created with HTML and CSS only, there are a few JS microinteractions but
                    these are mostly used to support the CSS.</p>


                <p>For this project I:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>created semantically correct code for a website</li>
                    <li>made the website accessibility-friendly</li>
                    <li>learned a lot about CSS positioning</li>
                    <li>learned how to make a website responsive</li>
                    <li>created different states for a lot of elements</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img src="../images/destaat/process1.png" alt="">
                <!-- <img src="../images/destaat/process2.png" alt=""> -->
                <img src="../images/destaat/process3.png" alt="">
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>End Result</h3>
            <p>I created a new, improved version of the website by <em>De Staat</em>. The website is accessible to people who use screenreaders, has a dark mode, high contrast mode, and crazy mode where laser beams appear.</p>
            <p>In the Github repository there is a lot to be read about the process of this project. The website is
                accessible on every possible screen - from the smallest phone imaginable to a huge monitor.</p>
