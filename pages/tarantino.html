            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Dress-up Game coded with HTML, CSS and Javascript. All illustrations were originally made for this
                project and this was my first experience with Javascript.</p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>For this project there weren't any guidelines as to what kind of product had to be made - as long as
                    Javascript was used.</p>
                <p>I decided to make a dress-up game with Tarantino characters. Pretty quickly I had an idea for the
                    layout and I stuck with it throughout the project.</p>
                <p>I had never worked with Javascript before so I struggled a lot with the coding, but I learned a lot.
                    Writing code is truly trial and error - a single comma can break your entire website.</p>

                <p>What I did for this project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>drew all of the illustrations</li>
                    <li>used functions, parameters, if/else statements</li>
                    <li>coded the game with html, css and javascript</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>End Result</h3>
            <p>This Dress-up Game has multiple categories: skin, hair, top, bottom, shoes, accessories & backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>Different kinds of outfits were directly inspired from the Quentin Tarantino movies Django Unchained,
                Inglorious Bastards and Pulp Fiction.</p>
            <p>Of course, all combinations can be made. When the Kill Bill combination is completely selected, the
                layout will change to red/yellow and the Kill Bill siren will be heard.</p>
